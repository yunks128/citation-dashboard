```![MOMO-CHEM model banner](../../static/img/momo-chem-banner.jpg)```

## Overview

MOMO-CHEM (Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications Chemistry) is an advanced atmospheric chemistry model designed to simulate the distribution and evolution of atmospheric composition at global and regional scales. Developed in 2014, MOMO-CHEM has become an important tool for studying air quality, atmospheric chemistry, and interactions between chemistry, climate, and human health.
