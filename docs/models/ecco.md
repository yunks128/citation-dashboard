# ECCO (Estimating the Circulation and Climate of the Ocean)

![ECCO model banner](../../static/img/ecco-banner.jpg)

## Overview

ECCO (Estimating the Circulation and Climate of the Ocean) is a state-of-the-art ocean state estimation system that combines ocean circulation models with diverse observational data. Initially developed in 2010, ECCO has become an essential tool for understanding ocean circulation, climate variability, and global ocean heat and freshwater content changes.

*Figure 3: Distribution of engagement levels for ECCO citations. Created using ggplot2 with geom_bar() and facet_wrap() to compare engagement levels across different time periods, with a sequential blue color palette representing depth of engagement.*

- **Level 1: Simple Citation** - References the paper without using the model (178 papers, 54.8%)
- **Level 2: Data Usage** - Uses ECCO data products or methodology (76 papers, 23.5%)
- **Level 3: Model Adaptation** - Modifies or extends the ECCO model (48 papers, 14.8%)
- **Level 4: Foundation** - ECCO is foundational to the research (22 papers, 6.9%)

The implementation rate (percentage of Level 2-4 citations) is 45.2%, one of the highest among comparable ocean models, indicating strong practical application.

## Geographic Impact

ECCO provides global ocean coverage but has been specifically applied to study key oceanographic regions.
