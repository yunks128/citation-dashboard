# ECCO (Estimating the Circulation and Climate of the Ocean)

## Overview

ECCO (Estimating the Circulation and Climate of the Ocean) is a state-of-the-art ocean state estimation system that combines ocean circulation models with diverse observational data. Initially developed in 2010, ECCO has become an essential tool for understanding ocean circulation, climate variability, and global ocean heat and freshwater content changes.
