![CMS-Flux model banner](../../static/img/cms-flux-banner.jpg)

## Overview

CMS-Flux (Carbon Monitoring System Flux) is a carbon cycle modeling system designed to quantify and monitor carbon fluxes between the atmosphere, land, and ocean. Developed in 2015, it has been instrumental in tracking carbon sources and sinks, supporting climate change research, and informing environmental policy decisions.
