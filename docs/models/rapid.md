# RAPID (River Application for Parallel computation of Discharge)

## Overview

RAPID (River Application for Parallel computation of Discharge) is a river routing model designed for parallel computation to simulate flow and discharge in river networks. Developed in 2011, RAPID has been widely applied to watershed modeling, flood prediction, and water resource management.
